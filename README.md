# Flyer Distribution Routes

In order to facilitate manual flyer distribution (i.e. for marketing, political flyering etc.) within a given region and with a fixed number of people, a given region should be split into equally sized clusters where eventually each cluster can be assigned to a person. The clusters should be equal in size (i.e. equal number of adresses within a cluster) such that every person gets a similar amount of work. Moreover the clusters should roughly follow cityblocks for simple orientation and hence increased efficiency within a given cluster (i.e. the clusters should not separate cityblocks which would make it more difficult to visually comprehend the boarders of a specific region when flyering for the first time).

Final solution (based on a novel, self-developed algorithm):
